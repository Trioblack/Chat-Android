Chat Android
============

this repository is android application for chat,and i'm using some technology like this:
<br>
1) node.js & socket.io for the server <br>
2) java android application and  [java-socket.io.client ](<https://github.com/clwillingham/java-socket.io.client>) for the client side.<br>
3) mongodb with [mongoose](<https://github.com/LearnBoost/mongoose>)for the database<br>



Running The Application
-----------------------

* install nodejs <br>
* install npm <br>
* install soket.io with npm <br> 
* install mongoose with npm <br>
* install mongoodb <br>
* run mongoodb service <br>
	`sudo mongod;`
* run socket.io server <br> 
	`sudo node app.js;`
* change url to your server
* ```java
	TestActivityInterface tac = new TestActivityInterface() {	
		@Override
		public void TestActivitySocket(IOSocket a, MessageCallback b) {
			// TODO Auto-generated method stub
			a = new IOSocket("http://192.168.1.22:3001", b);
	    		try {
	    			a.connect();
	    			a.setSessionID("loginsession");
	    			setSocketIo(a);
	    		} catch (IOException e) {
	    			// TODO Auto-generated catch block
	    			e.printStackTrace();
	    		}
